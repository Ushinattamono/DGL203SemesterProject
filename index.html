    <h1>DGL 203 Semester Project</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>For my Semester Project, I plan to create a website that serves as an archive for teams, information, and
        compositions implemented in Sdorica's Wonderland Trials; an event that changes weekly to pose different
        challenges to the player.
    </p>

    <p>To explain briefly, Sdorica as a mobile game has weekly levels dubbed the Wonderland Trials, where there are 36
        different levels that are divided into 8 levels per week, over a span of four weeks. These levels have fixed
        properties and conditions, while additional boons can be implemented per week.
    </p>

    <p>The player is limited to using a single team arrangement per stage, where the same team cannot be used
        concurrently for the remainder of levels; therefore, the goal is for the player to maximize their score total
        using different arrangements of characters over the span of 8 stages.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>The problem that the website plans to solve is the need for recordkeeping as the stages rotate on a weekly basis.
        It's difficult to remember which stages are currently on rotation, what challenges are within them, which teams
        are appropriate where, and what the teams were even used 4 weeks prior on the previous rotation. There are
        individuals who do keep their own notes, but do not co-operatively share solutions in the competitive
        environment, and this serves only to frustrate people who are looking for help.
    </p>

    <p>In order to solve this, the website will feature information of the weekly stages, the solutions for them used
        for the current week, and a history of solutions for them used in weeks past.
    </p>

    <h2>Deliverables and Goals</h2>
    <p>With this, I would hope that the website would serve to save time and effort spent in attempting these weekly
        stages as a resource to reference without rediscovering the stage challenges each week.
    </p>
    <p>In doing this project, the pieces that I plan to complete would have to be done incrementally per week. As the
        week rotates, I would have to acquire the information and record it to present on the website as it becomes
        available to collect. Ideally, all of the necessary information would be collected in a month, while I do have a
        backlog of teams kept in notes for a least 3 months prior to this project beginning.
    </p>

    <h2>Wireframes and Methods</h2>
    <p>In this section of the project proposal, I will do an overview about my layout and the methods I intend to use to
        accomplish them. In the first wireframe pictured below, we have the standard phone interface, and I will cover
        the labeled parts incrementally.
    </p>
    <p>Blue Labeled Features are non-actionable elements that the user does not interact with, while red features are
        actionable elements such as buttons and scrolling.
    </p>

    <h3>Blue Labeled Features</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Page Title
            <p>The page title grabs the class of the current active div, while not strictly a new page, displays the
                appropriate content of the selected week.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>2. Featured Team
            <p>A picture that is shown together with the selected Page Title

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>3. Team Use Information
            <p>A section within a grid that displays the information of the team within the current active div.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>4. Environmental Information
            <p>Similar to the team use, contains all the information not pertaining to the team.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>5. Collapsible Menu
            <p>A hamburger menu that shows when the first red feature is clicked upon.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Red Labeled Features</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Hamburger Menu
            <p>A hamburger menu that contains an unordered list of links that will populate the second sub-list menu
                with the appropriately selected stages of the selected week.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>2. Sub-List Menu
            <p>A second hamburger menu that selects the appropriate stage within the week and populates the rest of the
                content with it.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>3. Scroll Page
            <p>Nothing out of the ordinary here, the user is able to scroll the page.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>4. Collapse Menu
            <p>Essentially the same as the hamburger menu, the user is able to collapse the menu once it is opened.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>5. Page Select
            <p>Yet another common function of the hamburger menu once opened, you are able to select the desired week to
                view once you click on it.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
