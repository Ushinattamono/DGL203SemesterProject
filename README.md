# DGL203 Semester Project

## Overview
For my Semester Project, I plan to create a website that serves as an archive for teams, information, and compositions implemented in Sdorica's Wonderland Trials; an event that changes weekly to pose different challenges to the player. To explain briefly, Sdorica as a mobile game has weekly levels dubbed the Wonderland Trials, where there are 36 different levels that are divided into 8 levels per week, over a span of four weeks. These levels have fixed properties and conditions, while additional boons can be implemented per week. The player is limited to using a single team arrangement per stage, where the same team cannot be used concurrently for the remainder of levels; therefore, the goal is for the player to maximize their score total using different arrangements of characters over the span of 8 stages.

## Project Background

The problem that the website plans to solve is the need for recordkeeping as the stages rotate on a weekly basis. It's difficult to remember which stages are currently on rotation, what challenges are within them, which teams are appropriate where, and what the teams were even used 4 weeks prior on the previous rotation. There are individuals who do keep their own notes, but do not co-operatively share solutions in the competitive environment, and this serves only to frustrate people who are looking for help. 

In order to solve this, the website will feature information of the weekly stages, the solutions for them used for the current week, and a history of solutions for them used in weeks past.

## Deliverables and Goals

With this, I would hope that the website would serve to save time and effort spent in attempting these weekly stages as a resource to reference without rediscovering the stage challenges each week.
